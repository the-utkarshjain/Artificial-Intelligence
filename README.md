Artificial Intelligence 

This repository contains all the methods that are the basis of AI's most important industrial applications, in control and management of complex systems, information technology, and autonomous systems and robotics. They also form much of the new advanced software methodology that will revolutionize parts of information technologies in the next decades.

### Description:
- Astar:
  This folder contains the implementation of the A* algorithm which is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency.
- Bayesian Networks:
  This folder contains the implemenation of creating bayseian networks and solving probablities using them. This is useful in operation of many AI systems which involves uncertainty which may arise in a number of ways.
- Game tree search:
This folder contains game tree search using minmax and aplha-beta pruning. It also consists the implementation of Monte-carlo Search.
- Markov Decision Process: 
  This folder contains the decision making process of an AI using markov decison process when the states, transition probablities and rewards are well known. This contains the implemenation of value and policy iteration to get the best value and path.
- Partial Observability MDP: 
  This folder contains the decision making process of an AI using POMDP when the states, transition probablities and rewards are not cleary known or the surroundings is partially observable. This folder contains implementation of reinforment learning using Qlearning. 
- Sudoku Solver, Knight state: 
  These folder contains implentation of sudoku solver and state space search of knights on a chess board. Go ahead and fire them up to get the idea of power of AI.
